## 🌐 Overview

Project Cone (PJCone) is a **collaboration-centric web platform built on a "Closed-SNS" architecture.** It operates independently of central servers or public social media, functioning entirely through a **Self-Hosted Server** managed directly by the user.

The mission of PJCone is to provide a **secure, private digital environment** where teams, creators, and individuals can communicate, share resources, and document work without external surveillance. It seamlessly integrates messaging, project sharing, and lightweight creative tools into a single, sovereign ecosystem.

## 🔒 The Closed-SNS Concept

At its core, PJCone redefines social networking as a private, small-scale infrastructure.

### Key Characteristics
* **Self-Hosted Sovereignty**: You own the hardware, you own the data. Everything stays on your server.
* **Private-by-Design**: Access is strictly limited to invited members. No public discovery or global search.
* **Zero-Algorithm**: No distracting feeds, no tracking, and no dopamine-engineered recommendations.
* **Data Permanence**: Messages, logs, and resources are archived on your own terms, free from platform volatility.
* **Deep Trust Network**: Built for deep collaboration within high-trust groups or solo studios.
